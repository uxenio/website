# UXEN - Our website source code

This code is our full website. We wanted it to be light and quick so we didn't use javascript.

## Todo

Images need to be optimised for devices with higher pixel ratio.

## Getting Started

To get the website running on your machine you need Node.js and npm to be installed.
We've used the great parcel-bundler as a task runner, to install it globally run:
```
 npm install -g parcel-bundler
```

## Running the dev server

Run the web server locally by running the 'dev' npm script
```
 npm run dev
```

## Build for production

To build the project run the following command:
```
 npm run build
```
